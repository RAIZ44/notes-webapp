# Modern Note-Taking App

## Description
This is a simple web-based note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The application uses **localStorage** to persist notes between sessions and is styled with modern UI elements. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Features
- **Add Notes**: Users can create new notes using a pop-up form.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can edit existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can remove notes they no longer need.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work across different screen sizes.
- **Local Storage Support**: All notes are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage, allowing data persistence even after page refreshes.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app, including the container for the list of notes and the button to add new ones.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that defines the layout, colors, and overall styling of the app for a clean and modern look.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for creating, editing, deleting, and displaying notes. It uses localStorage to save and load notes.

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. No additional setup or dependencies are required.

## How to Use
1. Click on the "plus" icon to create a new note.
2. Write your note in the text box and click **Create Note** to save it.
3. Edit a note by clicking the "edit" icon (pencil), and delete a note by clicking the "delete" icon (trash can).
4. All notes will be displayed in the main container and will persist between sessions thanks to local storage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure

## Future Improvements
